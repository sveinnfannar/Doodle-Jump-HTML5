Design
------
Our game is made out of a game object which acts as a scene manager.
Our game scene has an entity manager which takes care of creating, updating and destroying the various entities in the game, such as
the platforms, the items and obstacles. It will randomly create platforms of varying types, depending on how far you've jumped and
will place all kinds of items for you to collect.

Our design makes it easy to add new types of items and platforms. We just need to implement the class and add a reference to it in the
entity manager and we're good to go.

The game automatically scales in size depending on device size so the game can be played on multiple different kinds of devices
